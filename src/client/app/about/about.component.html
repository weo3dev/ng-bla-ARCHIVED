<p>This app is the culmination of too many lost games over a few missed pins. And, to be honest, quite a lot of beer.</p>
<p>Bowling app market is lacking in a easy to use, mobile friendly, accessible fun <em>league</em> app for casual league play.</p>

<h3>Goals</h3>
<ul>
	<li>easy to use on mobile; responsive to larger screens </li>
	<li>league owners can admin all</li>
	<li>team leaders can invite/add/edit/delete/confirm team members</li>
	<li>team members can track personal goals</li>
	<li>bowling data tools available to manipulate granularly, spot weak points</li>
	<li>enable league communication for announcements</li>
	<li>deliver working app to my lovely DiverseyRiverBowl friends and frenemies, for use and enjoyment, by Q2 2017</li>
</ul>

<h3>Stack</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Angular 2 on up, using angular-seed which implements angular-cli as guide</li>
	<li>php restful api</li>
	<li>mysql db <-- why? Because relational data, thatâ€™s why.</li>
	<li><s>foundation for styling and solid sass base</s> - using Material Design at the moment, experimenting</li>
	<li>git - to save our souls when we are so very human and press delete at the wrong time</li>
</ul>

<h3>Notes</h3>
<ul>
	<li>this will evolve to exist as a <strong>production-level</strong> ready app. Testing, compliance, and best practices will be included</li>
	<li>this app will also act as a live example of different <em>evolving</em>  areas of Angular - January 2017 should be fun!</li>
	<li>this app will remain in beta until at least end of Q1 2017</li>
</ul>
